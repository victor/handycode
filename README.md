# Handy Code

A collection of handy reusable classes that don’t merit a full repo on their own.

## What’s available

Right now, the first class available is `VJPaddedLabel`, a `UILabel` subclass with built-in padding. I’ve missed this property on the core `UILabel`, and according to the number of times the question is asked on places like [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com), so do others.

## License

The code is available under the MIT License. Though it is not required, it’s appreciated if you send me a quick link (or a promo code) to your work if you use it.
